<p>This site contains an exploratory analysis, wherein we attempt different approaches to modeling and feature engineering to predict 3-year outcomes for New York City managed capital projects with budgets greater than $25 million using <a class="reference external" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Capital-Projects/n7gv-k5yt">an openly available dataset hosted by NYC Open Data</a>. Due to the limited scope and amount of data available in this dataset, this project can only be thought of as a proof of concept, which will need to replicated under more stringent standards with a larger set of more robust data.</p>

<p>This project’s online documentation is being actively developed. Therefore this site currently contains little more than a starting skeleton with which to document the project and its findings as they are developed.</p>

<p>Overall, we found promising results that, given a limited amount of project data, moderately accurate predictions could be made as to the 3-year budget change ratio and schedule change ratio for changes made on NYC capital projects. Ultimately, we explored a number of modeling methods ranging from basic linear regression (as an initial baseline), to smoothing spline generalized additive models (GAMs), to non-parameteric ensemble methods using decision tree regressors and boosting. In addition, using our limited dataset, we sought to extract the greatest amount of predictive information as possible from it by focusing heavily on feature engineering. Methods for feature engineering included competing methods for generating latent “reference class” categories for each project using K-means clustering as well as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) in combination with the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, which took into account all categorical and quantitative characteristics of our training project. Additionally, we use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) embeddings of the textual information available for each project, and further encoded those embeddings into a smaller, more usable feature-space through competing methods of dimensionality reduction such as principal compenent analysis (PCA), latent space encoding with a dense autoencoder neural network, and UMAP.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, linear models lacked the expressiveness needed to successfully model our predictions, particularly those for budget ratio change of our test projects. Not only were there drastic differences in the predictive performance of models on both budget change ratio and schedule change ratio as as our primary response variables, but models also needed to be individually parameterized for optimal predictions on each of those two response variables.</p>
<p>In the end, through the use of ensemble decision tree regressors using boosting, we were able to achieve test $R^2$ scores of $0.48$ on our budget change ratio predictions and $0.70$ on our schedule change predictions. While there is still a great deal of additional work we can put towards this problem, we feel that this analysis is a good starting point for more principled exploration.</p>
